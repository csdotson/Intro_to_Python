# Assignment 2 - Fizz Buzz
# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive.
# But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number.
# For the multiples of five print “Buzz” instead of the number.
# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz” instead.
